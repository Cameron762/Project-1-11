Project description: 
 
This project will intake data on Houston, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas in order to study the correlation between increased population and cost of living. We will then look at how these affect the crime rate in each city as well.
 
Research questions to ask: 
 How has the population changed over the past 3 years?
 By what percentage?
 Has cost of living increased or decreased over the past 3 years?
 By what percentage?
 Was there more or less crime reported over the past 3 years?
 By what percentage?
 In which areas of the city was there the most crime?
 What is the average cost of living in that area?
 In which areas of the city was there the least crime?
 What is the average cost of living in that area?
